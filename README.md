# <h1 align="center">:us::girl: What U.S. people think about abortion - EDA with Python :girl::us: <img src="https://github.com/PrinceCorwin/Useful-tech-icons/blob/main/images/python.png" width="50" height="50"></h1>

## **1. Introduction** :pushpin:

- **Objective**: By Exploratory Data Analysis, this project studies how the survey campaign has been conducted, what we still don't know about the respondents' demographic, and more importantly, what US people really think about abortion in various historical periods, ages, sex, and other factors.

- **Target Audiences**: The findings may provide some meaningful information for those who are interested in abortion. Meanwhile, this project is also for employers to see my ability in data analysis and visualization with Python.

## **2. Dataset**:microscope:

- **Data Source:** ["Abortion Opinons in the General Social Survey"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/abortion-opinions-in-the-general-social-survey) was derived from the General Social Survey and uploaded by UTKARSH SINGH on Kaggle - a popular working environment for workers in Data and Machine Learning.

## **3. Findings Summary** :bulb:

 * <mark><b>Respondent info</b></mark> 
    * The survey was conducted on ~4500 people at multiple times in their life.<br>
    * Most of the respondents spent at least 12 years in school.<br>
    * People from 22 to 60 years old are the major respondents of this survey.
   
   
 * <mark><b>Survey Collection</b></mark> 
    * From 1995, the frequency of collecting survey has been changed from every year to once every 2 years.
    * What is more, the annual survey total after 1995 increased significantly.<br>
    
    
 * <mark><b>Opinions</b></mark>
    * 43.1% of the respondents didn't stand in either side of the argument about abortion for any reason.
    * More than 50% of them agreed with abortions in case of 'possibility of defect in babies','effect on mom's health', and 'the baby as a result of rape'.
    * With questions about 'wanting no more children','poor mom', and 'mom wanting to be single', the 3 options seemed to distribute equally.<br>
    
 
 * <mark><b>Opinions vs Decade</b></mark>
    * People live in past (80s and 90s) usually choose to stand in either side, while people from 2000s are more likely to be neutral in most survey questions.<br>
    
 
 * <mark><b>Opinions vs Race, Sex, and Age</b></mark>
    * Age has a negative correlation with Opinion variables.
    * In case of abortion for any reason, the proportion of opinons within each race are the nearly the same, with 'disagree' and 'no opinion' more than 'agree'.
    * The same result goes with Sex.
