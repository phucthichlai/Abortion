## **1. Introduction** :pushpin:

- **Objective**: By Exploratory Data Analysis, this project studies how the survey campaign has been conducted, what we still don't know about the respondents' demographic, and more importantly, what US people really think about abortion with regards to historical period, age, sex, and other factors.

- **Target Audiences**: The findings may provide some meaningful information for those who are interested in abortion. Meanwhile, this project is also for employers to see my ability in data analysis and visualization with Python.

## **2. Dataset**:microscope:

- **Data Source:** ["Abortion Opinons in the General Social Survey"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/abortion-opinions-in-the-general-social-survey) was derived from the General Social Survey and uploaded by UTKARSH SINGH on Kaggle - a popular working environment for workers in Data and Machine Learning.
